GDB View of MRK3 Memory:
-------------------------

GDB is using a 32 bit address type for accessing simulator memory.
This is required to allow access to the memory which is currently 
not visible to the cpu (e.g., system mode memory in user mode).The 
interpretation of the 32bit address format is described below.

The most significant byte of the address is interpreted as follows.

MSBit                                     LSBit
  --------------------------------------------------
  | MS3 | MS2 | MS1 | MS0 |  X  |  x  |  X  |  MT  |
  --------------------------------------------------

- The most significant nibble is used as memory space (MS) selector.
  The information is required to differentiate memory spaces (e.g, user
  mode and system mode memory). The following values are defined:
    - 0: access the mapped memory based on the state of the cpu
          This is used to enable the debugger of fetching variable
          contents etc. from the memory with exact the same view on
          the memory as the cpu has.
    - 1: system mode memory
    - 2: user mode memory

- The least significant bit contains a memory type (MT) flag.
  The flag is used to distinguish between code and data memory.
  The following values are defined:
    - 0: data memory.
    - 1: code memory
  The location of the flag was chosen to be able to easily distinguish
  between data and code memory (when displaying	addresses with hex radix).

The remaining three bytes of the GDB address are used as address bytes.
