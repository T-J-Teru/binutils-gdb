# Test the 'maint test-remote-args' command.
#
# We do minimal testing in here.  If you are thinking of adding a new
# test here then you are most likely adding the test in the wrong
# place.  Remote argument testing is checked in the following test
# scripts: gdb.base/args.exp, gdb.base/inferior-args.exp,
# gdb.base/startup-with-shell.exp, and gdb.python/py-inferior.exp.
# The test gdb.gdb/unittest.exp also runs 'maint selftest
# remote-args', which are the remote argument self tests.
#
# If you have a new test for an argument that was being passed
# incorrectly, then add the test to one of those scripts.
#
# This file is ONLY for validating that the 'maint test-remote-args'
# command itself is working.
