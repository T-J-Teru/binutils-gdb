#
# When STUB_SUITABLE is true this test is suitable for use with
# gdbserver, i.e. INFERIOR_ARGS can be passed through to
# gdbserver_start via gdb_run_cmd.  Some of the weird quoting used in
# some of the tests doesn't seem to play well with gdbserver_start.
# This is a TCL issue, not a gdbserver issue.  Manually testing with
# gdbserver shows no problems.  It's just that when we try to invoke
# gdbserver from TCL the argument quoting gets messed up.  For tests
# that are problematic, STUB_SUITABLE is false.
