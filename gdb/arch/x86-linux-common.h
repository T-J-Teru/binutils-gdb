/* Format of XSAVE extended state is:
	struct
	{
	  fxsave_bytes[0..463]
	  sw_usable_bytes[464..511]
	  xstate_hdr_bytes[512..575]
	  extended state regions (AVX, MPX, AVX512, PKRU, etc.)
	};

  Same memory layout will be used for the coredump NT_X86_XSTATE
  representing the XSAVE extended state registers.

  The first 8 bytes of the sw_usable_bytes[464..467] is the OS enabled
  extended state mask, which is the same as the extended control register
  0 (the XFEATURE_ENABLED_MASK register), XCR0.  We can use this mask
  together with the mask saved in the xstate_hdr_bytes to determine what
  states the processor/OS supports and what state, used or initialized,
  the process/thread is in.  */
