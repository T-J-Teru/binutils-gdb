   action is where linker relaxation occurs, it is linker relaxation that
   loads the contents of the .mrk3.records sections, and this must be done
   before the fix-up as the fix-up actually causes the records sections to
   become unloadable, here's why....

   .... each records section has a version number at the front, when the
   sections are merged we only want a single version number at the very
   front of the merged output section.  So, here, we remove the version
   number from the front of every input record section except the first, in
   this way when the sections are all merged they are correctly formatted,
   with a single version number at the front.  However, if, after this
   fix-up we tried to load the records from anything but the first records
   section, then the section contents would be invalid.   */
