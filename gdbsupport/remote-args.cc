/* This file contains the function used for splitting an argument string
   into separate arguments in preparation for sending the argument over the
   remote protocol, as well as the function to merge the separate arguments
   back together into a single argument string.

   The logic within these functions is slightly more complex that it should
   be.  This is in order to maintain some level of backward compatibility.

   In the following test example of command line arguments will be given.
   To avoid confusion arguments, and argument strings will be delimited
   with '(' and ')', the parenthesis are not part of the argument itself.
   This is clearer than using quotes, as some of the examples will include
   quotes within the arguments.

   Historically, the algorithm used to split the argument string into
   separate arguments removed a level of quoting from the arguments.  For
   example consider the following argument string: (abc* abc\*).  The
   historic algorithm would split this into (abc*) and (abc*).  Notice that
   the two arguments are identical.  On the remote end we are now destined
   for failure, either we apply an escape to both '*' characters, or we
   apply an escape to neither.  In either case, we get one of the arguments
   wrong.  The historic approach was just broken.

   However, the historic approach has been in place for many years.
   Clearly not all arguments were corrupted in the manor described above,
   so lots of things did work.  For example, the string: ("ab cd" "ef")
   will be split into (ab cd) and (ef).  And the string ('"') will become
   just (").

   What we can observer from all of these examples, is that the historic
   approach at the remote end was to simple apply an escape to every
   special shell character, quotes, white space, as well as every other
   special character (e.g. (*)).  The problem with this approach is that
   sometimes special shell characters shouldn't be escaped.

   If we could start from scratch, then the simple approach would be to
   retain all escaping while splitting the argument string, and, where
   quotes are used, convert this into backslash escaping as neeeded.  Thus
   the argument string ("ab cd" "ef") would become (ab\ cd) and (ef).  And
   the argument string (abc* abc\*) would become (abc*) (abc\*).  On the
   remote end, joining these arguments is as simple as concatenation with a
   single space character between.

   However, if we took this approach, then consider ("ab cd").  Previously
   this was sent as (ab cd), but now it would be (ab\ cd).  This breaks
   backward compatibility.

   And so, this is where the complexity comes in.

   The strategy here is to split the arguments, removing all double and
   single quotes.  While removing quotes, special shell characters are
   escaped as needed.  But, white space characters, and quote characters
   are not escaped.  These characters must always be escaped, and so we can
   safely drop the escape in these cases, this provides some degree of
   backward compatibility.  */
