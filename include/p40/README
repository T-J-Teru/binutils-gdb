This folder is used for inclusion of the p40 header files. The following files
are required:

 - P40_DLL.def
      Contains a list of functions exported by the dll.
 - P40_DLL.h
      Describes the interface to the MMU.

In addition, the GNU linker needs to know which functions are exported by
the dll. Therefore, using the *.def file, an *.a file can be created which
is then included when linking GDB. This is done using a dlltool executable
which is part of MinGW/MSYS. The commandline is

    dlltool.exe --input-def P40_DLL.def --output-lib P40_DLL.a
